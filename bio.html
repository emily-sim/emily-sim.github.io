	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hi there, I'm Emily. Los Angeles native displaced in the wild, wild city of Boston. I'm a Tufts Jumbo that studies Computer Science. I'm interested in big data and design that prioritizes accessibility. Outside of school, catch me attending concerts two nights in a row but also flying to public education reform conferences. As a 1.5 generation Korean-American, I'm passionate about movements and immigration rights. </p>
